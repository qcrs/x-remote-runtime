# Project State

Current baseline: validated Gate 8D Runtime and installable SDK.

| Item | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware | Iluvatar MR-V100 / 智铠100 |
| CoreX | 4.4.0 |
| Architecture | aarch64 |
| Protocol | CRX9 / VERSION 3 |
| Public library | `libcorex_remote_cudart.so.1` |
| CUDA ABI | `COREX_REMOTE_CUDART_1.0`, `COREX_REMOTE_CUDART_1.1` |
| Extension ABI | `COREX_REMOTE_EXT_1.0` |
| Development repository | `/home/lvtong/corex-remote-runtime` |

The repository migration preserves the validated Runtime behavior. Gate 8
history, patch scripts, and generated validation outputs are retained under
`docs/gate8/` and `evidence/gate8d/` for reference; they are not development
entrypoints.

The next development area is Runtime hardening:

- multi-host-thread behavior;
- DSO lifecycle;
- failure and session semantics;
- CUDA API compatibility expansion.

The migration itself adds no CUDA functionality and does not begin Gate 9.
